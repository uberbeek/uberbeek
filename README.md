ðŸŽ¯ **About Me**

Iâ€™m a data scientist with a background in experimental psychology, trained to ask meaningful questions, design rigorous analyses, and tell compelling data stories. After earning my PhD and working in academia, I transitioned into data science through TripleTenâ€™s Data Science Program.

Now, Iâ€™m seeking opportunities to apply my skills in real-world settingsâ€”especially where psychology, behavior, and data intersect.
